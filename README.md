Snippets for integrating Calendly tracking with Google Analytics for your website.

The default Calendly-Google Analytics integration tracks the Calendly widget events in isolation from the page views and events on your website. This is fine unless you are using Calendly for lead generation and want to look at your Calendly usage as part of an integrated marketing plan.

The code here will allow you to integrate website and Calendly widget data using Google Tag Manager and Zapier.

Some customization is required. Please see the accompanying blog post for instructions.
